<h1 id="header">How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>

<a href="https://privat24.ua/#login" target="_blank"><img src="images/alarm.jpg" width="307" height="450" alt="Будильник" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="40"><a>

<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p align="center" id="2abzac">What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
applies even more to the online world, than in regular
business.</p>

<p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
start.<strong>A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</strong></p>

<p><em>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
become all the more critical.</em> Your challenge <b>for success</b> is
simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p>So <i>what are the greatest online time wasters</i> and what can
you do to avoid them?</p>

<ol start="0">
<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
<li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
<li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h2>

<p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
retype the same old simple information.</p>

<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
communicating words quickly.</p>

<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility <a href="http://google.com.ua" target="_blank" title="google">ссилка на гугл</a> , but
there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
available.</p>

<h2>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h2>

<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
own installed on your computer.</p>

<p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
through them afterwards and pull back any that have
been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

<p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.</p>
